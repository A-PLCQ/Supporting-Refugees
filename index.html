                        <p> JR born in Paris on February 22, 1983, is a French contemporary and milltant artist. Using
                            the
                            technique of photographic collage, he exhibits freely in public spaces around the world. In
                            2017, JR
                            created a massive installation depicting Kikito, a young boy peeking over the border fence
                            that
                            separates the United States and Mexico.

                            the mariachi group and thus forget the separation for a moment.

                        <p>What you're seeing on the left is the largest artistic fresco in the world. This project was
                            started
                            by Enrique Chiu. Of Mexican origin, is a Californian artist who wishes to challenge society
                            through
                            his paintings.
                            "It all started five years ago. I painted a part of the wall near my home in Tijuana at the
                            request
                            of an association helping migrants. Since then, every year, I paint a new section for a
                            different
                            association."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2016, he posted this project named “hermandad mural” (brotherhood mural)
                            And surpinzingly, there was a buzz and he recived a lot of encouragement messages but above
                            all he
                            recived help. Indeed, no more thant 2,730 people have contributed their brushstrokes!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In an interview by France 24 in 2018, he concluded with these words: "The idea is to ensure
                            that
                            this wall is seen in another way. I wanted to use it as a canvas, a way to express ourselves
                            freely
                            and positively."

                        However due to various factors like climate change or wars, those number can only increase. It is
                        important to remind everyone you can that migration concerns us all one way or another. Humans
                        helping humans is the only solution, that is why we must do what we can, at our scale, even if we
